<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h3>

<p>The game consist of a boat that belongs to the user, the user has to beat other pirates boats with weapons that belong to this boat, it also has to deal with creatures that would attack the boat whenever they have the opportunity. There are different kinds of boats, these boats depend on the difficulty that the player choose to play, but the enemies would be the same in every level the difference is that it would take longer to get rid of them.</p>

<h3>
<a id="easy-level" class="anchor" href="#easy-level" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easy Level</h3>

<p>In this level the player may or may not face creatures it all depend on the luckiness that the player has, the player would navigate for a period of time until it gets to the pirate boat which it would have to face in order to pass the level. The health of the boat would be shown in a bar that it would decrement if this receives damage, if the boat receives a considerable amount of damage than it would be destroyed and the game would end. </p>

<h3>
<a id="medium-level" class="anchor" href="#medium-level" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Medium Level</h3>

<p>The second level would present the user a new scenario and a different boat which would look better than the past one, as mentioned before the enemies would be the same but their resistance would increase and therefore it gets harder to kill them.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hard-level" class="anchor" href="#hard-level" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hard Level</h3>

<p>in this level the scenario and the user boat would change, the creatures would have a heavy resistance and in order to pass this level the user would face two bosses one would be a pirate boat which would be real hard to beat and it would face a mutant creature named “MarDiabuculus”.</p>
